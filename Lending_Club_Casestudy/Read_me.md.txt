AIM(Goal):
The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as 
denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which
 are strong indicators of default.
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

Outcome of Casestudy:
1.)Features that contribute towards the loan default.
2.)Assumptions is fine as long as its clearly mentioned in the jupyter notebook.
3.)Coding Comments are Important.
